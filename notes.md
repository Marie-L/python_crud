# Notes


- why is namespace `__name__ __main__` created  ?
- `w+` ?
- `r` ?
- http://127.0.0.1:5000 ?
- how to navigate to `bin` dir?

### Tips

##### Vim commands

`i` - insert

`yy` - yank (copy)

`p` - paste

`dd` - delete current line


##### dev env errors

- xcode needs to be updated

- python installed but not linked, run `brew link python3`
- Error `Error: Permission denied @ dir_s_mkdir - /usr/local/Frameworks`
- check permissions, run  `ls -lh /usr/local`
- change permissions, run `sudo mkdir /usr/local/Frameworks` then `sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local/Frameworks`
- run `brew link python3` again. Result `Linking /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.7.3... 1 symlinks created`

- run `pipenv shell`
 

##### hidden branches ðŸ˜© 

 - run, `git branch -a`
 
 #### test
 
 each one is isolated, so basically nothing is created and carried over to the next test.
 
 the number in the tests
 
 - must define the route
 - must delete the file
 - must return user feedback
 - must get json data to get name etc
 - find out how to delete py files
 - must read the test and check every other tests and requests etc.
 
 
 #### api essentials
 
 - The API itself never _makes_ requests, only _handles_ it.
 
 - In this app the _requests_ are made _within the tests_, therefore they act as the user and interact with each end point.
